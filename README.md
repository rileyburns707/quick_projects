# quick_projects
I have a goal to be able to code easily while on an airplane.

This may seem like a strange goal, but to me, if someone can do something on an airplane then they have truly mastered it. 

I am doing these to learn the basics for myself and gain confidence on my own abilites rather than relying on online resources and AI. All of these projects are done by trial and error, searching things online, and only asking AI for help to explain concepts NOT write code. They are not meant to be flashy, but rather simple projects that allow me to gain confidence. 

## Calculator
This is a simple calculator GUI. It was my first project during this campaign of projects, and I had a great time doing this. I used Tkinter for the first time and learned about designing GUIs, using algorithms in projects not just leetcode, truly understanding the concept of a try except blocks, and what happens behind the scenes when I use Git with Github. 

The actual project was simple and any method or function I didn't know I could pretty simply find online and read about. What took the most time was taking the time to really break down what happens when I use terminal commands. I wanted to understand magic behind Git. It was actually not as bad as I thought it would be and was surprised that it is basically just creating a folder behind the scenes that is connected to other commands. Learning about Git made me want to make my own git as a project one day. Maybe I'll do that towards the end of this project campaign as a final challenge.

## Quote Generator
This is a simlple GUI that calls an API to generate quotes. I feel really proud of this project because I feel it is very polished. I was able to think of edge cases for the UX, handle errors, and use OOP to create it. Since it was a small project it felt very managable to use OOP and I felt like I was comfortable doing it with no help. I was suprised by how little I relied on google and AI to ask for help. I would say I wrote 90% of it by looking at the previous project's code for tkinter syntax, and the rest by what I felt would work.

The big reason I did this was to get experience with APIs in a digestable project. I had used APIs for previous projects (Smart Mirror being the most APIs used), but it was good practice to be able to create the whole request process. I would say my big take aways from this project are using APIs and creating GUIs. I did not have too much trouble with this so I feel like it is a good step in the right direction to be able to code a whole project on an airplane!
