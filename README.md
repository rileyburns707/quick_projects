# quick_projects
I have a goal to be able to code easily while on an airplane.

This may seem like a strange goal, but to me, if someone can do something on an airplane then they have truly mastered it. 

I am doing these to learn the basics for myself and gain confidence on my own abilites rather than relying on online resources and AI. All of these projects are done by trial and error, searching things online, and only asking AI for help to explain concepts NOT write code. They are not meant to be flashy, but rather simple projects that allow me to gain confidence. 

## Calculator
This is a simple calculator GUI. It was my first project during this campaign of projects, and I had a great time doing this. I used Tkinter for the first time and learned about designing GUIs, using algorithms in projects not just leetcode, truly understanding the concept of a try except blocks, and what happens behind the scenes when I use Git with Github. 

The actual project was simple and any method or function I didn't know I could pretty simply find online and read about. What took the most time was taking the time to really break down what happens when I use terminal commands. I wanted to understand magic behind Git. It was actually not as bad as I thought it would be and was surprised that it is basically just creating a folder behind the scenes that is connected to other commands. Learning about Git made me want to make my own git as a project one day. Maybe I'll do that towards the end of this project campaign as a final challenge.
